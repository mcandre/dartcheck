# dartcheck - a Dart port of the QuickCheck unit test framework

## HOMEPAGE

http://www.yellosoft.us/quickcheck

## EXAMPLE

	$ dart example.dart
	Random bool: false

## WARNING

The PRNG is Dart's `Math.random()`, which [fails](http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=771) to exhibit any form of seeding as of Dart v0.07. Until this is fixed, test cases generated by dartcheck will not begin to cover the input space to any properties passed to `dartcheck.for_all()`.
